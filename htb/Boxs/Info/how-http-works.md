## How HTTP works


Think that you are in restaurant and you want to do a command to restaurant server this the restaurant menu

Here in Web you are the `Client` ,the menu is the web page where you are at the moment and you make a order to a `server` and you can make also multiple order (mp4 files, png, html  files) .It also possible for `server` to receive multiples orders from multiples `Client` and sand any command answers at any `Client`


So HTTP = stateless ?
Yes HTTP is stateless because any HTTP request is independant with others request and the server don't keep in memory historical of back request
